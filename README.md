# ðŸ”« FPS Game

This is a 3D first-person shooting game created for a workshop assignment. The game allows you to choose between two weapons â€” rifle or pistol â€” and includes engaging features like sound effects and patrolling enemies.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

The game begins in an open natural environment. The player must defeat enemies inside a closed stage building to win.  
There are three enemies: one drone and two patrol units. Each enemy has three states â€” **patrolling**, **alert**, and **attack**:

- **Patrolling**: Enemies move between specific waypoints.
- **Alert**: Triggered when an enemy detects a collision with the player; it rotates 360Â° to search for the player.
- **Attack**: The enemy actively attacks the player.

The player can switch between the rifle and pistol using the **1** and **2** keys.

Inside the closed stage is a **key** that must be collected to open a shortcut door.

The player starts with **100 HP** and a **shield** that absorbs 50% of incoming damage. Once the shield is depleted, health will take 100% of the damage.
